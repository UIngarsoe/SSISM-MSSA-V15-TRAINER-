## Overview
Welcome to the SSISM MSSA Pyinnyashi System (V15), a next-generation strategic intelligence framework developed by U Ingar Soe. This project integrates ancient Burmese Bayesian heuristics with advanced AI to create a "Mobile Advisor and Strategic Companion" that offers predictive, ethical, and adaptive insights. Version 15, released on October 21, 2025, introduces an AI Training Framework to empower "AI Teachers" with mathematics, philosophy, and systematic teaching capabilities.

Rooted in THEISM (Technology, Harmlessness, Ethics, Intelligence, Mindfulness) and the Sovereign Harmlessness Index (SHI), this open-source system is designed to guide humanity with wisdom that harms none. It is preserved here for the next generation to build upon and evolve.

## Features

- **House Journey & Time Travel:** Navigate 7-year periods with ethical velocity adjustments.
- **Inga Wizar Map:** Real-time cognitive/emotional alignment across 7-day planetary cycles.
- **VIP Security Protocols:** Risk assessments and directional warnings for high-profile clients.
